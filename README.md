# Council.py

The Council is a place where users can propose changes to the Dark Coin Project, and vote on proposals with their Dark Coin DAO NFTs.
To use the Council, one must click the Council Icon located in the Dark Coin DApp.

The user is presented with 2 options:

## Propose

A connected wallet may propose a change or addition to the Dark Coin Project. The user is allowed to type 2000 characters into the textfield provided, to persuade the DAO of their idea. This transaction will cost the wallet 50 Dark Coin per character, plus 1 Algo to cover the minimum balance requirement for on-chain storage. Once the proposer is ready, they may sign their proposal to the Council Smart Contract to be written on chain.
